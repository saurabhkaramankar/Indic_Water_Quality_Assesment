##  Indic_Water_Quality_Assesment 

---

This project aimed to develop a predictive model for water quality assesment using various factors such as pH, temperature, taste, odor,'Temp', 'D.O. (mg/l)', 'PH','CONDUCTIVITY (Âµmhos/cm)', 'B.O.D. (mg/l)', 'NITRATENAN N+ NITRITENANN (mg/l)', 'FECAL COLIFORM (MPN/100ml)','TOTAL COLIFORM (MPN/100ml), The linear regression model built in this project achieved an accuracy of 78% in predicting the quality of water samples. This model has practical applications in the industry and can benefit both state and country.

Government can use the model to assess the quality of their river water of the state and make decisions about cleaning and processing. People can also make decisions when drinking water or using river water based on its predicted quality. However, it is important to validate the model's performance on new, unseen data to ensure its generalizability before implementing it in practical applications.

Furthermore, there may be additional factors that influence water quality beyond the scope of the factors considered in this project, which could be explored in future research. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and predictive modeling highlights the importance of understanding the underlying factors that influence water quality index.
